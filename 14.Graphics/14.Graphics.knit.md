## What is propensity score?

Propensity scores(PSs)

- defined by Rosenbaum and Rubin at 2014[@Steiner2010]\cite{the1983rosebaum}
- the probability of receiving certain treatments, conditional on observed baseline covariates
- estimated by using modeling to predict treatment allocation with covariates
- two patients with similar PSs have covariates which come from similar distributions

## What is propensity score analysis?

 <!-- ![The framework of propensity score matching.](./61857-PB5-7762-R1.png) -->
A poor balance indicates that the model estimating PS needs 
to be respecified.

## What are the advantages of PSA?

- dimension reduction
  - multiple covariates are replaced by one score to describe a patient
- design separation
  - separate covariate balancing and effect estimating

## Why choose PSM in R?


## R packages

| R Package    | Version   |Description |
|--------------|-----------|------------|
| Hmisc | 1.99      | *7*        |
| MatchIt | **1.89**  | 5234       |

## How to generate the dataset?

- Constructed a dataset with known true PS values.

- Simulates the relationship between smoking and cardiovascular disease (CVD).

  - CVD is the outcome variable (CVD = 0 or 1)
  - Smoking is a binary variable (whether the patient smoking or not)
  - Gender (female = 0, male = 1)
  - Age

- **Real data is not as simple as the simulated data.**

## Codes


```r
> set.seed(2022)
> x.Gender <- rep(0:1, c(400, 600))  # 400 females and 600 males
> x.Age <- round(abs(rnorm(1000, mean = 45, sd = 15)))
> z <- (x.Age - 45)/15 - (x.Age - 45)^2/100 + 2 * x.Gender
> tps <- exp(z)/(1 + exp(z))  # The true PS
> Smoke <- as.numeric(runif(1000) < tps)
> z.y <- x.Gender + 0.3 * x.Age + 5 * Smoke - 20
> y <- exp(z.y)/(1 + exp(z.y))
> CVD <- as.numeric(runif(1000) < y)
> x.Age.mask <- rbinom(1000, 1, 0.2)  # Missing completely at random
> x.Age <- ifelse(x.Age.mask == 1, NA, x.Age)
> data <- data.frame(x.Age, x.Gender, Smoke, CVD)
```
*tps* is the true PS which can balance data and needs 
to be estimated

## Data

```
#    x.Age x.Gender Smoke CVD
# 1     59        0     1   1
# 2     NA        0     0   0
# 3     32        0     0   0
# 4     23        0     0   0
# 5     40        0     0   0
# 6      1        0     0   0
# 7     NA        0     0   0
# 8     49        0     1   0
# 9     NA        0     0   0
# 10    NA        0     0   0
```

## Summary
- summarize the distribution of baseline variates in each group
- test whether significant differences exist between different groups

```r
> library(tableone)
> table2 <- CreateTableOne(vars = c("x.Age", "x.Gender", "CVD"), data = data, factorVars = c("x.Gender",
+     "CVD"), strata = "Smoke", smd = TRUE)
> table2 <- print(table2, smd = TRUE, showAllLevels = TRUE, noSpaces = TRUE, printToggle = FALSE)
> write.csv(table2, file = "./Table2_before_matching.csv")

## Table

\small
For continuous variable x, SMD of
$$
 x = \frac{\bar{x_1}-\bar{x_2}}{\sqrt{(Var_1+Var_2)/2}}
$$
\footnotesize
$\bar{x_1}$ and $\bar{x_2}$ are the sample means for the treated and controlled groups, respectively.

\small
For dichotomous variable x, SMD of
$$
 x = \frac{\hat{p_1}-\hat{P_2}}{\sqrt{\left [ \hat{p_1}(1-\hat{p_1})+ \hat{p_2}(1-\hat{p_2}) \right ]/2}}
$$
\footnotesize
$\hat{p_1}$ and $\hat{p_2}$ are the prevalence of dichotomous variables in the treated and control groups, respectively.

## Second example

The data come from the [**Early Childhood Longitudinal Study (ECLS)**](https://www.childandfamilydataarchive.org/cfda/archives/cfda/studies/4075) and cannot be made available directly due to ECLS's Terms of Use. 

Once you have accepted the **Terms of Use**, you'll be able to quickly create an easy-to-analyze dataset.
(which will end up in 'data-processed/ecls.csv').

## 介绍

::: {.quotation data-latex="[John Gruber]"}
A Markdown-formatted document should be publishable as-is, as plain text, 
without looking like it’s been marked up with tags or formatting instructions.  
:::

Markdown 提供一种简洁的格式语法，用来编辑 HTML、PDF 和 MS Word 文档，数学公式还是用 LaTeX 排版的好， 
$\boldsymbol{\Sigma}$ 是希腊字母 $\Sigma$ 的加粗形式，
$\mathcal{A}$ 是普通字母 $A$ 的花体形式。

## 自定义 block

::: {.exampleblock data-latex="{提示}"}
记得安装一些 LaTeX 宏包，如果不记得也没关系，大多数情况下 tinytex [@tinytex] 会找齐依赖安装好，只是初次运行会有点慢！


```r
> # 安装 LaTeX 宏包
> tinytex::tlmgr_install(c("psnfss", "iitem", "beamer-verona"))
```
:::

## bib

# ```{r bib, eval=FALSE, include=FALSE, cache=FALSE}
# bib <- knitr::write_bib(
#   x = c(
#     .packages(), "tinytex"
#   ), file = NULL, prefix = ""
# )
# bib <- unlist(bib)
# bib <- gsub("(\\\n)", " ", bib)
# xfun::write_utf8(bib, "psmR.bib")
# ```
